                              CURRENCY CONVERTER

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Currency conversion is an essential task for travellers , businesses and financial
analysts to compare values across different currencies. Manual conversions using 
calculator or lookup tables can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project 
aims to provide a simple,automated tool for converting amounts between major 
currencies with minimal user input.


SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
1. Supports conversion among eight widely-used currencies : INR,USD,GBP,
   EUR,JPY,CHF,CAD and AUD.
2. Handles direct currency pair conversions based on predefined static exchange 
   rates.
3. Validates user input to ensure supported currencies and positive numerical
   amounts.
4. Runs as a command-line interactive application without requiring internet or
   external dependencies.
5. Does not cover real-time exchange rate updates or multi-step conversion chains.


TARGET USERS :
1. Beginner programmers learning Python and currency conversion logic.
2. Individuals needing quick offline currency conversions between supported 
   currencies.
3. Educational use for understanding basic conditional statements and dictionary 
   usage in Python.


HIGH LEVEL FEATURES:
1. User prompts for source currency,target currency and amount.
2. Input validation with user-friendly error messages for unsupported currencies 
   or invalid amounts.
3. Conversion logic using hardcoded exchange rates stored in a Python dictionary.
4. Result output with formatted conversion amount for clarity.
5. Graceful handling of unsupported conversion pairs with appropriate messages.
